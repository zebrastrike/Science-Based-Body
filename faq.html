                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">What are peptides?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Peptides are small amino acid chains that the body already produces and has in circulation. By replicating these naturally occurring signals, researchers can target specific organs or biological functions. There are over 3,500 known peptides, and the field of peptide research is constantly expanding. Many experts believe peptides will have a transformative impact on health science comparable to the discovery of antibiotics.</p>

              <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">Do I have to use peptides indefinitely to maintain results?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Not necessarily. Peptides are amino acid chains that signal your body&rsquo;s own functions or target organs to perform specific tasks &mdash; your body does the actual work. For example, once collagen is synthesized, it remains. Your fibroblasts receive a signal to increase collagen production (a process that occurred naturally when you were younger), and then they carry out that function. Each peptide is different, so the specific target and function determines the recommended research cycle length and frequency.</p>

              <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">Do peptides work for men?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Yes. There are compelling research results showing men using GHK-Cu topically with a derma stamp for hair-related studies, as well as other research applications. Peptides are not gender-specific &mdash; they function based on biological signaling and cellular pathways.</p>

              <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">How long are peptides stable after reconstitution?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Stability varies significantly by peptide. Some peptides like TB-500 degrade more quickly, while many GLP-1 compounds can remain effective for approximately 90 days after reconstitution. Beyond that window, potency may diminish. Unreconstituted peptides (before liquid is added) can remain stable for 18 months to over a year when stored properly. The reconstitution liquid also matters &mdash; bacteriostatic water works for most peptides, but some (like IGF-1) are better preserved with acetic acid.</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Start with your goals. Ask yourself: &ldquo;What three specific outcomes am I looking for?&rdquo; With over 3,500 known peptides, the options are extensive. Just because a particular combination works well for one researcher&rsquo;s objectives doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the best fit for yours. Selecting peptides based on your own specific research goals is the most effective approach.</p>

                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">What is GHK-Cu?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine) is a naturally occurring peptide found in human plasma, saliva, and urine. Key research findings include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age-related relevance:</strong> GHK naturally declines with age, making its replenishment a significant area of study for skin and tissue research.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copper complex:</strong> GHK forms a complex with copper (Cu&sup2;+), which has been extensively studied for its role in wound healing and skin repair processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collagen support:</strong> Research indicates it stimulates collagen synthesis while supporting balanced breakdown, contributing to skin resilience and structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extracellular matrix:</strong> Supports glycosaminoglycan production and extracellular matrix remodeling for improved skin texture and elasticity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tissue support:</strong> Studies show it enhances collagen, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and small proteoglycans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Research demonstrates it attracts immune and endothelial cells to injury sites, promoting faster healing responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aesthetic research:</strong> Studies suggest improvements in skin elasticity, density, and firmness.</li>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Research suggests that once collagen is synthesized, it remains intact. Peptides are not like ongoing prescriptions &mdash; they are amino acid chains that trigger a specific biological function. You do not need to continue GHK-Cu indefinitely to maintain the results that have already been achieved. Many researchers do continue because of the broad range of studied benefits, but it is not required to preserve prior outcomes.</p>

              <div class="accordion-item">
                <button class="accordion-trigger" type="button">Can I store GHK-Cu blended with other peptides in the same vial?</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p><strong>No &mdash; this is an important storage consideration.</strong> GHK-Cu (copper peptide) is not compatible for long-term storage with BPC-157, TB-500, or KPV. The copper will denature those proteins and render them ineffective. Degradation begins within approximately 24 hours of blending.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>BPC-157 + TB-500</strong> can be stored together without issue, as they remain stable without copper present.</li>
                    <li>Blended formulations containing GHK-Cu are designed for clinical or medspa environments where the entire vial is used within the same day.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Purchase GHK-Cu separately from other peptides and store it in its own vial.</p>

                  <p>The GLOW Stack is a research-focused combination built around five key areas: collagen production, skin laxity, metabolism, gut health, and regenerative support. It includes GHK-Cu, BPC-157, and TB-500 &mdash; three peptides with complementary research profiles.</p>

                  <p>Snap-8 is a topical peptide that functions similarly to a mild form of botulinum toxin but is applied externally rather than by injection. It is commonly used in serums and alongside microneedling or nanoneedling protocols. SBB offers a topical serum combining GHK-Cu and Snap-8, designed for those exploring non-injectable options or looking to complement existing aesthetic protocols.</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>DAC stands for Drug Affinity Complex. CJC-1295 on its own has a relatively short half-life of approximately 30 minutes in circulation. By adding DAC, the peptide&rsquo;s active duration is significantly extended, allowing for less frequent research protocols. CJC-1295 without DAC follows a pattern more closely aligned with natural hormonal cycling, which some researchers prefer for that reason.</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                  <p>Both are multi-receptor agonist peptides currently under study, but they differ in their mechanisms:</p>
                  <p><strong>Tirzepatide</strong> &mdash; Dual agonist (GLP-1 + GIP):</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>GLP-1:</strong> Studied for its role in appetite signaling and blood sugar regulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>GIP:</strong> Researched for its effects on chronic inflammation modulation.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Retatrutide</strong> &mdash; Triple agonist (GLP-1 + GIP + Glucagon):</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Includes the same GLP-1 and GIP activity as Tirzepatide.</li>
                    <li>Adds a <strong>glucagon agonist</strong>, which research suggests specifically targets fat metabolism by supporting mitochondrial preference for fat oxidation while preserving lean mass.</li>
                    <li>Clinical trials have demonstrated it may preserve lean tissue more efficiently while supporting metabolic rate.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Separate research has shown over a 600% increase in collagen production in fibroblasts from GHK-Cu, which is why many researchers pair GHK-Cu alongside GLP-1 compounds in comprehensive research protocols.</p>
